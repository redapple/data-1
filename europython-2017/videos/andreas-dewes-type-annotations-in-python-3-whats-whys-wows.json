  "description": "Python 3.5 introduced support for \"type hints\" (or annotations),\nwhich allows us to annotate our code with useful bits of information\nwithout affecting its runtime behavior. Type hints don't enforce a\nparticular use case and can therefore be used for many purposes.\n\nIn my talk, I will explain some of the use cases of type hints, and\nshow how we can use them to e.g. make our code more secure or teach\nit new tricks. We will have a look at popular libraries that help us\nto use the power of type hints (e.g. mypy), but we will also see how\nwe can build our own extensions on top of the type hint system.\n\nAfter the talk you should walk away with a solid (basic) understanding\nof type hints in Python and an idea of how they might be useful to\nyou now or in the future.\n\n- Typing and type hints in programming languages\n- Short history and motivation of type hints in Python\n- Basics of type hint syntax and semantics\n- Use cases for type hints\n- Type hints for code analysis: mypy and similar libraries\n- Building new stuff with type hints in Python\n- Summary, Outlook & Further Reading",

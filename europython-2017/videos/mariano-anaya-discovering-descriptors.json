  "description": "Python is full of amazing (yet often overlooked) features, that can\nhelp us write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code. One of\nthem is the descriptors interface.\n\nBy means of descriptors, we can run code when accessing or setting\nproperties of another object. This can have a lot of applications,\nand keeping descriptors in mind might come in handy when facing a\nhard problem.\n\nThe goal of the talk is to explore descriptors, and how they can be\nwritten, as well as analysing some interesting examples in well-known\nlibraries or projects in order to identify scenarios where\ndescriptors are the Pythonic way to go.",

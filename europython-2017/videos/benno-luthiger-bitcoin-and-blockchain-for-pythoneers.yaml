  Why should a Python programmer be interested in Bitcoin and the
  Blockchain technology?

  Blockchain technology is one of the fastest moving part in the
  Fintech area. However, the Blockchain is not only the basis of crypto
  currencies. First of all itâ€™s a decentralized registry that cannot be
  modified. This means that using a Blockchain, users can trust in the
  validity of a dataset without the need to establish a central
  authority. Thus, the Blockchain can be used to store records e.g. of
  land ownership or and other property rights in countries with weak or
  corrupt or otherwise incompetent authorities.

  Therefore, Python programmers with an understanding of this
  technology are especially well prepared to contribute in this area,
  because the agility inherent to Python makes it easy to program in a
  fast moving environment. The fact that various applications in the
  Bitcoin and Blockchain area are implemented in Python prove this
  notion. However, the reverse is also true: An understanding of the
  distributed ledger technology possibly enables you to solve problems
  in projects you encounter in the near future.

  In this talk, I will present the following topics:

  -   The Blockchain architecture: nodes, transactions, headers.
  -   The Bitcoin protocol and its proof of work (POW)
  -   Smart contracts
  -   Bitcoin alternatives: Proof-of-work (PoW) compared to Proof-of-stake (PoS)

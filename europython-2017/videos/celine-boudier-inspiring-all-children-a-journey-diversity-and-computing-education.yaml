  Do you remember when you wrote your first line of code? Do you
  remember who inspired you  to become who you are when you were a
  child? But also, what the challenges might have been?

  I remember when I was a little girl with a strong interest in a lot
  of things, including science, and what and who helped me pursue an
  education and a career in science and technology. However, my journey
  in the industry from France to the UK, from software engineer student
  to team lead, from language processing to robots to online coding
  games, made me understand there is still a lot of work to be done in
  terms of diversity.

  I will talk about my own experiences, what shaped my dreams and
  inspirations, the reality check, and the project I’m now working on
  Code For Life.

  Code For Life is an initiative started at Ocado Technology in 2014,
  in response to the UK putting computing in the primary school
  curriculum. It comprises a small full time team and also a large
  group of dedicated volunteers who focus on creating free, open source
  games, mostly web games developed with Django, to teach all children
  how to program. We are all dedicated to inspire all children and give
  them the tools and opportunities they deserve.

  Motivation - Matching data collections with the aim to augment and
  integrate the information for any available data point that lies in
  two or more of these collections, is a problem that nowadays arises
  often. Notable examples of such data points are scientific
  publications for which metadata and data are kept in various
  repositories, and users’ profiles, whose metadata and data exist in
  several social networks or platforms.

  In our case, collections were as follows: (1) A large dump of
  compressed data files on s3 containing archives in the form of zips,
  tars, bzips and gzips, which were expected to contain published
  papers in the form of xmls and pdfs, amongst other files, and (2) A
  large store of xmls in the form of xmls, some of which are to be
  matched to Collection 1.

  Problem Statement - The problems, then, are: (1) How to best unzip
  the compressed archives and extract the relevant files? (2) How to
  extract meta-information from the xml or pdf files? (3) How to match
  the meta-information from the two different collections? And all of
  these must be done in a big-data environment.

  The presentation will describe the solution process and the use of
  python and Spark in the large-scale unzipping and extraction of files
  from archives, and how metadata was then extracted from the files to
  perform the matches on.

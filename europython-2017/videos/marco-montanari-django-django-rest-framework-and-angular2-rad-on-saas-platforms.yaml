  Rapid Application Development has been a major topic for the desktop
  development world. Yet, desktop development has proven to be at the
  end of its timeline and the latest major environment is now the web
  in its many forms (from browser to Electron and similars). Django
  offers an amazing infrastructure and Django Rest Framework an amazing
  middleware to solve most of the problems. The RAD development on
  Angular2 is then enabled by a set of libraries developed at Modal
  Nodes for both front and backend that ease the development of the
  front end tools and front end interactions with both unauthenticated
  and authenticated systems via JWT and Djoser. Specifically, we will
  see the changes in the metadata that will enable better interactions
  and the usage of both the backend elements and the front-end ones in
  order to ease development.

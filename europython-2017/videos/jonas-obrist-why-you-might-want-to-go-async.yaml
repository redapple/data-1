  Asynchronous programming is becoming a hot topic in the Python
  community, especially with the rise of popularity of Python 3 and the
  new asyncio library in its standard library. However, it can still be
  a confusing and mysterious concept. In this talk, I will explain what
  async programming is, how it works and how it could benefit you. My
  goal of this talk is that at the end of it, you have an idea about
  what we mean when we say asynchronous programming in Python and you
  know how and when to use it.

  In the first part of the talk, I will dive into what asynchronous
  programming is and what it isn't. Explaining the difference between
  IO bound code and CPU bound code.

  Then I will explain how this actually works in Python, explaining the
  idea of an event loop, coroutines and cooperative multitasking.

  Finally, I will talk about why this may be beneficial, what kind of
  applications can really benefit from this and provide some examples
  from my experience.

  Historically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain
  for even the most devoted Python enthusiasts. I've found myself in
  the situation, where I did know the basic concepts behind the tools,
  but despite that only thing I could do was following tutorials. That
  was the time to change it and that's the reason this presentation was
  written.

  In this talk, I'll provide a quick overview of the current state of
  Python packaging tools. I'll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and
  wheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their
  precursors. I'll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth
  knowing. Then I'll share examples of how you can use the features of
  the Setuptools library - those well known and those we use when
  pip-installing packages, but most of us can't name them.

  The point of this presentation is to explain how to use tools which
  are all there, just waiting to make developing, testing, and
  distributing our Python packages easier. Doesn't matter if you're a
  Python expert or a beginner - the knowledge covered by this
  presentation will be useful despite your level.

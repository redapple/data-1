  "description": "The pandas library represents a very efficient and convenient tool\nfor data manipulation, but sometimes hides unexpected pitfalls which\ncan arise in various and sometimes unintelligible ways.\n\nBy briefly referring to some aspects of the implementation, I will\nreview specific situations in which a change of approach can make\ncode based on pandas more robust, or more performant.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- inefficient indexing\n- multiple dtypes and efficiency\n- implicit type casting\n- HDF5 storage overhead\n- GroupBy.apply()... when you don't actually need it\n\nUPDATE: slides and materials can be found at http://pietrobattiston.it/python:pycon#europython_rimini_july_2017",

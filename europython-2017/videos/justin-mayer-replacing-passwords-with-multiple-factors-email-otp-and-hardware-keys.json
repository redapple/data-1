  "description": "Passwords have formed the cornerstone of I.T. system authentication\nfor decades, but recent high-profile breaches have underscored the\nrisks of password-based authentication systems.\n\nThe good news is that we can replace passwords with other factors:\n\n- email-based authentication\n- one-time passwords (OTP)\n- hardware keys (Yubikeys/U2F, etc.)\n\nThese factors can be used independently or in conjunction with one\nanother to provide vastly greater security than the traditional\nusername-plus-password combination.\n\nAttendees of this talk will walk away with a detailed understanding of:\n\n- why the traditional username-plus-password combination is failing us\n- why email-based authentication provides no less security\n- overview of one-time passwords and TOTP\n- how to store/retrieve OTP codes, including password manager support\n- state of hardware keys in general, and FIDO U2F standard in particular\n\nAttendees will learn how to implement these multi-factor\nauthentication methods in their own Python-based web applications,\nwith primary focus on methods for integrating email-based\nauthentication, one-time passwords, and U2F hardware keys into\nDjango-based projects.",

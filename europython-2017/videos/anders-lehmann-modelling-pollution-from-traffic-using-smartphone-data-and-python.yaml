  The talk presents results from my PhD project on models for transportation
  related pollution.

  Pollution from personal transport in Cities is a big and growing problem.
  By monitoring the flow, and congestion in the transport system two goals
  can be achieved. First, the adherence to agreed limit values
  (or breaking said limits) can be followed and used to decrease
  health effects of local pollution hotspots. Secondly, monitoring
  of the total emission of climate forcing gases from transportation,
  is important for designing climate mitigation actions.

  Python is used in combination with other tools to convert sensor data
  from smartphones, into pollution concentrations in urban settings.
  To mitigate the lack of complete data coverage, the missing data is
  simulated by a traffic model, to locate congestion and model the
  traffic related pollution concentration.

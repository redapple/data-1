  Despite 12 years of history and wide popularity the workings of
  Git still remain largely a mystery for many.
  A lot of Git users operate it just by remembering a bunch of commands
  and repeating them in a correct order.
  I was one of them until I decided to dig deeper into how Git actually
  works and suddenly I understood that internally Git operates by rather
  simple principles and after you figure them out suddenly all those
  commands start to make sense.

  To look into the Git's internal structure you need a programming language
  to crunch the data and Python fit perfectly for this task.

  In this talk, I will dig into the internals of Git with Python,
  that will help you better understand how Git works.

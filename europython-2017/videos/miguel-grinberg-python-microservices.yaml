  This talk is for Python web developers interested in learning what
  are the core ideas behind microservices, what problems they try to
  solve, and what are the viable options to implement them in Python,
  both from technical and teamwork point of views. Some of the topics
  that will be discussed include the role of APIs, the improvements
  microservices bring to application scalability, upgrades, and
  maintenance, and the challenges in breaking up a monolithic
  application.

  Attendees will leave the talk with a good idea of what microservices
  are, and how they help build better applications. As usual with my
  presentations, there will be actual code examples presented during
  the talk that I will also host on GitHub, for those interested in
  investigating further on their own.

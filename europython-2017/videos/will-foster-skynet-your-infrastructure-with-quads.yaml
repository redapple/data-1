  The very small 2-person DevOps team within Red Hat Performance/Scale
  Engineering has developed a set of Open Source Python-based systems
  and network automation provisioning tools designed to end-to-end
  automate the provisioning of large-scale systems and network switches
  using tools like Foreman, Ansible, and other Open Source bits.

  QUADS – or “quick and dirty scheduler” allows a normally overburdened
  DevOps warrior to fully automate large swaths of systems and network
  devices based on a schedule, even set systems provisioning to fire
  off in the future so they can focus on important things like Netflix
  and popcorn or not reading your emails while your datacenter burns in
  an inferno of rapid, automated skynet provisioning. QUADS will also
  auto-generate up-to-date infrastructure documentation, track
  scheduling, systems assignments and more.

  In this talk we’ll show you how we’re using QUADS (backed by Foreman)
  to empower rapid, meaningful performance and scale testing of Red Hat
  products and technologies. While QUADS is a new project and under
  constant development, the design approach to handling large-scale
  systems provisioning as well as the current codebase is consumable
  for others interested in improving the efficiency and level of
  automation within their infrastructure.

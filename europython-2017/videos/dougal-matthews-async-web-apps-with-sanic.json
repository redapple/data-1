  "description": "This talk will introduce you to Sanic, the Python 3 web framework\nthat supports async request handlers with a simple, Flask-like, API.\n\nWe will start with a Sanic overview and compare it with other similar\noptions before looking at the API and working through a basic app.\nOur goal here will be to get a feel for the Sanic API and demonstrate\nhow it fits together. After this we will cover some of the more\nunique and interesting possibilities with Sanic, such as support for\nwebsockets and HTTP2.\n\nA web framework is often only as powerful as its ecosystem, so we\nwill take a look at some of the popular Sanic extensions for\ndatabases, templating and testing.",

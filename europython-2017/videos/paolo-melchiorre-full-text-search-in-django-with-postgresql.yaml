  After some experiences in the implementation of full-text search
  functionality with different system, we have decided to use
  PostgreSQL to implement full-text search functionality in our next
  project, a website to search for shows, venues, bands and festivals.

  In the past, I have worked in two different projects, a mobile
  platform to sell and buy used items and a sport videos sharing
  platform, where I used two of the most currently famous full-text
  search software (Elasticsearch or Solr) but I had some
  synchronization and management problems.

  After that, in my company, we searched for new Django support of
  full-text search PostgreSQL implementation and we decided to use it
  to avoid any problems that I had in the past.

  I’m going to start speaking about the full-text search in a general
  context and I want to show the problems I encountered implementing it
  in the past.

  Afterwards, I’m going to talk about the PostgreSQL functionality to
  implement the full-text search functionality and also present the
  django.contrib.potgres.search module, with step-by-step
  demonstrations of its functions with real world data.

  Finally, I’m going to show the way we use and test this functionality
  in our project and which functionality lacks us to have a complete
  implementation of full-text search in our project.

  At the end, I want to present my conclusions about our solution and I
  want to explore some new features that will be present in the next
  versions of Django and PostgreSQL.

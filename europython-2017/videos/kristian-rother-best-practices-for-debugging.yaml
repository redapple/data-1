  Debugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is
  assumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have
  to deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial
  attempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and
  corresponding programming techniques.

  In this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for
  systematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a
  series of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with
  increasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining
  one-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in
  an entertaining way.

  "description": "Python on mobile devices is still negligible mostly because of the\nGUI problems which arise. But Python on android devices is considered\nto be a solved problem since the module Python for Android is\navailable. We have nowadays at least the possibility to develop for\nmobile devices with the GUI engine Kivy which is maybe the first\nchoice for rapid prototyping on that platform. But as it comes to\ndesign work and mobile device look alike Kivy is still far behind the\nweb development tools HTML/CSS.\n\nIn our talk we present a conceptual work where we used Ionic - this\nis an mobile development framework based on Angular - to build the\nGUI part of an app and connected that to a Python back end. In our\npoint of view our proposal is very general and will give Python a\nboost towards modern UX development and makes HTML/CSS/JavaScript a\nreal option especially in combination with Angular.\n\nThe main part of our solution that we show is the interoperation\nbetween JavaScript and Python such that asynchronous calls in both\ndirection are possible.\n\nThe advantage is to develop UX and back end code only once and use it\nliterally on every platform where a Python interpreter and a browser\nruns.",

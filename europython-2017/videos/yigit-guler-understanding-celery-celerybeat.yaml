  Celery is a distributed task queue for Python. Although it is most
  popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage
  from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a
  function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance
  &amp; usability to the applications that we build.

  This talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and
  its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by
  introducing key components with the help of various real-world
  examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue
  systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about
  Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.

  We will be looking for the answers to the following questions:

  - What is a distributed task queue?
  - What are the main elements of Celery?
  - When should we use Celery tasks?
  - How do we use Celery Beat?

  Attendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.

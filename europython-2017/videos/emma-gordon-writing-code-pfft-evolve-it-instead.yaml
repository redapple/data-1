  We're heading into a future of delivery drones, driverless cars and
  3D-printed ""hoverboards"" ...

  With machines now able to perform many tasks better than humans, some
  people are going to be out of a job.

  But not software developers, right?! Could a computer generate the
  code you currently write for a living?

  In this talk, we'll take a look at one of the many biologically
  inspired approaches to AI - Genetic Algorithms, and how they can be
  used to generate code given a description of the function that that
  code should perform.

  Spoiler - you're probably not out of a job, yet...

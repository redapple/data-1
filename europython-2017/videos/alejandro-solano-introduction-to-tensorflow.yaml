  Deep learning is at its peak, with scholars and startups releasing
  new amazing applications every other week, and TensorFlow is the main
  tool to work with it. However, Tensorflow it's not an easy-access library for beginners in the field.

  In this talk, we will cover the explanation of core concepts of deep
  learning and TensorFlow totally from scratch, using simple examples
  and friendly visualizations.

  The talk will go through the next topics:

  - Why deep learning and what is it?
  - The main tool for deep learning: TensorFlow
  - Installation of TensorFlow
  - Core concepts of TensorFlow: Graph and Session
  - Hello world!
  - Step by step example: learning how to sum
  - Core concepts of Deep Learning: Neural network
  - Core concepts of Deep Learning: Loss function and Gradient descent

  By the end of this talk, the hope is that you will have gained the
  basic concepts involving deep learning and that you could build and
  run your own neural networks using TensorFlow.

  Python 3.5 introduced support for ""type hints"" (or annotations),
  which allows us to annotate our code with useful bits of information
  without affecting its runtime behavior. Type hints don't enforce a
  particular use case and can therefore be used for many purposes.

  In my talk, I will explain some of the use cases of type hints, and
  show how we can use them to e.g. make our code more secure or teach
  it new tricks. We will have a look at popular libraries that help us
  to use the power of type hints (e.g. mypy), but we will also see how
  we can build our own extensions on top of the type hint system.

  After the talk you should walk away with a solid (basic) understanding
  of type hints in Python and an idea of how they might be useful to
  you now or in the future.

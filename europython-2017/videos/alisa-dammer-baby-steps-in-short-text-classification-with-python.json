  "description": "This talk aims to provide an information about where and how one could\nstart using simple text-classification models.\nAdditionally it will be shown how a python classificator  can be incorporated\ninto existing system.\nThe presentation will be broken into 3 topics and a conclusion.\n\nFirst, the presentation provides an overview of how the problem was\napproached, what information was useful or not and how the technologies\ntack shown in the second part was decided on.\n\nSecond part will concentrate on using Naive Bayesian model for text classification.\nHow the model was trained, what difficulties were met and how they were solved.\nAdditionally the talk will give a brief overview of other possible model choices\n(random forest, SVM).\n\nThe third part will show how the model was deployed and used in the\nproduction. One architecture solution will be shown in details\n(REST calls between Java Client and Flask Server), while other\npossibilities will be mentioned briefly.\n\nAs the conclusion the possible improvements for the model in use will\nbe suggested as well as short example of supervised learning algorithm\n(CNN) and unsupervised classification algorithm (LDA) for the same purpose.\nAlong with the examples the proc and cons will be named.\n\nTechnologies mentioned and used: Flask, Green Unicorn vs uWSGI, NLTK,\nSci-Kit, Python 3, Java 8, Jersey, Docker, Kubernetes",

  This is not a tutorial. It's an attempt to expose non data scientists
  experienced pythonistas to the powerful pandas library. Most of
  python developers don't use pandas (either because they never heard
  of it, felt that it's a too steep learning curve or never thought
  that it will be useful for them). I intend to talk about python
  performance limitations and show how pandas can be used to overcome
  some of these limitations. The talk will be accompanied by a live
  Jupiter Notebook session that will demonstrate a typical use of
  pandas.

  "description": "The very small 2-person DevOps team within Red Hat Performance/Scale\nEngineering has developed a set of Open Source Python-based systems\nand network automation provisioning tools designed to end-to-end\nautomate the provisioning of large-scale systems and network switches\nusing tools like Foreman, Ansible, and other Open Source bits.\n\nQUADS \u2013 or \u201cquick and dirty scheduler\u201d allows a normally overburdened\nDevOps warrior to fully automate large swaths of systems and network\ndevices based on a schedule, even set systems provisioning to fire\noff in the future so they can focus on important things like Netflix\nand popcorn or not reading your emails while your datacenter burns in\nan inferno of rapid, automated skynet provisioning. QUADS will also\nauto-generate up-to-date infrastructure documentation, track\nscheduling, systems assignments and more.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll show you how we\u2019re using QUADS (backed by Foreman)\nto empower rapid, meaningful performance and scale testing of Red Hat\nproducts and technologies. While QUADS is a new project and under\nconstant development, the design approach to handling large-scale\nsystems provisioning as well as the current codebase is consumable\nfor others interested in improving the efficiency and level of\nautomation within their infrastructure.",

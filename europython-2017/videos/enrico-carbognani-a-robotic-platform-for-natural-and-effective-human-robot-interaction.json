  "description": "This  talk deals  with  the usage  of  artificial  intelligent\ntechniques  in  humanoid  robotics. The focus is on human\u2013robot\ninteraction with the goal of building a robotic platform which\nembodiments are able to interact in natural and effective way with\nhumans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions. The system\nis fully implemented in Python and based on the Robotic Operating\nSystem (ROS). The talk will describe the hardware and software\nconfiguration of our currently NAO based humanoid platform.  The\nstrategy has been to use available high level Python libraries for\nspoken language processing, sentiment analysis,  vision,  interfacing\nwith Artificial Intelligence applications  in   order   to   provide\ncurrent edge technologies performances.   The overall system\narchitecture is based on finite state machines nodes interacting via\nthe ROS communication layer.\n\nThe main fields of applications that the platform is targeting are:\n\n- Entertainment\n- Education\n- Field robotics\n- Home and companion robotics\n- Hospitality\n- Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT)\n\nWe will present the latest status of the platform together with a NAO based demo.",

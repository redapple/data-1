  "description": "Chopsticks lets your import and run Python code on remote Unix hosts\nover SSH. It works with no code deployment and no preinstalled\nsoftware other than Python and SSH. It has built-in support for\nrunning code on many hosts in parallel.\n\nUnlike Fabric or Ansible, Chopsticks not opinionated about the\nstructure of the code you run, allowing it to be used for\norchestration, auditing, diagnostics, monitoring probes, and more\n\nAlso unlike these, Chopsticks is not wedded to SSH, so it can\ntransparently work on Docker containers over pipes, local\nsubprocesses - and in future, sudo?\n\nDaniel will demonstrate Chopsticks in action, walk through the API,\nand explain the three clever tricks that Chopsticks is built on.",

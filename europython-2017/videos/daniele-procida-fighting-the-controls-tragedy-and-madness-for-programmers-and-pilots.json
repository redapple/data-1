  "description": "Damn it, this can\u2019t be happening! As programmers, we find ourselves\ntime and again spiralling down into tighter loops of desperate\ntroubleshooting, fighting the controls of our machinery and\ndescending into what feels like a kind of madness. Later, when it\u2019s\nall over, we realise that the clues we needed to recover the\nsituation were staring us in the face all along, but we somehow\ncouldn\u2019t even see them.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this: the nature of debugging for programmers\nmeans that it quickly tips us into these states, and then very\neffectively keeps us there.\n\nIn programming we have worked hard to improve some aspects of\nprogrammers\u2019 work, creating methodologies, development frameworks,\nparadigms, practices and thinking deeply about how to solve the\nproblems of producing good code. We have done very little work to\nimprove the way we debug our code,\n\nThe good news is that although programmers have not developed very\nadequate strategies or techniques for mitigating the risks that\ndebugging draws us into, other industries, and in particular\naviation, have. We can learn from their lessons without paying their\nprice.",

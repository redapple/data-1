  "description": "Celery is a distributed task queue for Python. Although it is most\npopular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage\nfrom system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a\nfunction into a task is quite easy and can add great performance\n&amp; usability to the applications that we build.\n\nThis talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and\nits uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by\nintroducing key components with the help of various real-world\nexamples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue\nsystems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about\nCelerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.\n\nWe will be looking for the answers to the following questions:\n\n- What is a distributed task queue?\n- What are the main elements of Celery?\n- When should we use Celery tasks?\n- How do we use Celery Beat?\n\nAttendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.",

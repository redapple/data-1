  In 2012 not a lot of people were interested in Python in the
  relatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer
  girls were interested in Python. During (Jona Azizaj and me) our talk
  we will share the story of how we, a small but dedicated group of
  people, jump started the community in a small country like Albania
  and what other small cities and countries should avoid during their
  first steps in developing a Python community in similar conditions.
  Most important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the
  Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic
  steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other
  communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also
  nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in
  technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are
  going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls
  and the steps we should take to fix it.

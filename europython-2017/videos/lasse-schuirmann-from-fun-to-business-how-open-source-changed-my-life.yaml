  Coala (https://coala.io/) began as a fun project. We never believed
  there would be anything useful growing out of it - and yet it did.
  Contributors all over the world came to us and helped creating the
  community as it is.

  But how did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main
  contributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?

  This talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we
  can learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over
  founding an open source project to building a freelance agency and
  founding a startup.

  Participants will learn how they can grow an open source project,
  automate newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start
  making a living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There
  is no single recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the
  tips and tricks weâ€™ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for
  entrepreneurs, wanna-be-freelancers and future or past open source
  project founders.

  This talk is completely new and has not been presented at any
  conference yet although it overlaps with previous talks of mine which
  have received much positive feedback at previous regional PyCons. It
  will be tested at a local meetup to ensure proper timing.

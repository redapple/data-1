  "description": "In recent months, Artificial Intelligence has become the hottest\ntopic in the IT industry. In this session, we\u2019ll first explain how\nDeep Learning \u2014 a subset of AI \u2014 differs from traditional Machine\nLearning and how it can help you solve complex problems such as\ncomputer vision or natural language processing. Then, we\u2019ll show you\nhow to start writing Deep Learning applications in Python thanks to\nMXNet, a popular library for Deep Learning for both CPUs and GPUs.\nWe'll also see how to use pre-trained models and we'll load one on a\nRaspberry Pi equipped with a camera. Finally, we\u2019ll show random\nobjects to the Pi\u2026and listen to what it thinks the objects are,\nthanks to the text-to-speech capabilities of Amazon Polly.",

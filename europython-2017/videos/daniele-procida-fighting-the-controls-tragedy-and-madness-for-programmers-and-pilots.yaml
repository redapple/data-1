  Damn it, this can’t be happening! As programmers, we find ourselves
  time and again spiralling down into tighter loops of desperate
  troubleshooting, fighting the controls of our machinery and
  descending into what feels like a kind of madness. Later, when it’s
  all over, we realise that the clues we needed to recover the
  situation were staring us in the face all along, but we somehow
  couldn’t even see them.

  There’s a reason for this: the nature of debugging for programmers
  means that it quickly tips us into these states, and then very
  effectively keeps us there.

  In programming we have worked hard to improve some aspects of
  programmers’ work, creating methodologies, development frameworks,
  paradigms, practices and thinking deeply about how to solve the
  problems of producing good code. We have done very little work to
  improve the way we debug our code,

  The good news is that although programmers have not developed very
  adequate strategies or techniques for mitigating the risks that
  debugging draws us into, other industries, and in particular
  aviation, have. We can learn from their lessons without paying their
  price.

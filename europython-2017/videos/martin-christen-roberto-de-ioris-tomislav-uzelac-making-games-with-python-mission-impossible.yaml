  A discussion about making full-featured, commercial games in python,
  both 2D and 3D.

  Looking at state of the art approaches to using python in gaming, we
  will compare the alternatives: pygame (2D API), OpenGL (via
  pygame/pySDL2), Unreal Engine 4 and the Godot Engine (with further
  comparison to Unity 3D game engine).

  We will also look at other benefits of using python in the gaming
  context, such as integration with 3D modelling software, scripting
  the asset pipeline and GIS data integration.

  Finally, can (and should) python move beyond being the language of
  plugins and scripts, and become the main language for creating game
  development projects?

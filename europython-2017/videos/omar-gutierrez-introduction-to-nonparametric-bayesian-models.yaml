  When we use supervised machine learning techniques we need to specify
  the number of parameters that our model will need to represent the
  data (number of clusters, number of Gaussians, etc.).

  Somewhat,  we are making our model inflexible.  In this talk we will
  study the nonparametric models, in specific, Bayesian Nonparametric
  Models (BNP) whose main purpose is getting more flexible models since
  that in BNP the parameters can be automatically inferred by the
  model.

  The outline is the next:

  - Parametric vs Nonparametric models
  - A review on probability distributions
  - Non-parametric Bayesian Methods
  - Dirichlet Process
  - Python (and R maybe) libraries for NPB
  - Conclusions

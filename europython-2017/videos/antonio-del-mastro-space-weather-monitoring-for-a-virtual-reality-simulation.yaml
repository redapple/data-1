  High-energy particles accelerated by the Sun during Coronal Mass
  Ejections (CME) are a major concern for a manned mission to Mars. On
  Earth surface, these particles are shielded by the Earth magnetic
  field. In space and on the Martian surface, where such shielding is
  absent or much weaker, CME pose a radiation hazard to the health of
  astronauts. The development of tools to understand and forecast the
  interplanetary space weather is a requirement for future manned space
  missions in order to properly protect the astronauts from the
  radiation environment. A variety of methods are currently developed
  by the scientific community and a number of public tools for space
  weather monitoring and forecast is already available online.

  We present a Python-based tool which takes advantage of two publicly
  accessible space weather web portals. Our software combines the
  forecast of CME and a real-time propagation model of energetic
  particles throughout the inner Solar System and the Martian
  atmosphere. It consistently recovers real-time relevant information
  and provides with days-to-hours forecasts for the radiation dose
  astronauts on Mars would be exposed to. The system raises an alert
  signal when the radiation dose exceeds the security levels defined by
  the main space agencies adopted as a reference. Our tool is meant to
  be integrated in a virtual reality simulation of a human settlement
  on the surface of Mars (Mars City Project www.mars-city.org).

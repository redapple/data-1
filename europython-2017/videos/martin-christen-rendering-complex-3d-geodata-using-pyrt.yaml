  PyRT (pronounced ""pirate"") is a rather new open source project
  creating a ray tracer in pure Python and some optional CPU/GPU
  acceleration using bindings. Ray tracing is a technique for
  generating an image by tracing the path of light.

  PyRT was created to render large 3D City models. In this talk, the
  possibilities and experiences of ray tracing in Python using pyRT are
  shown. pyRT also runs in the Jupyter Notebook.

  Rendering complex 3D-Geodata, such as 3D-City models with an
  extremely high polygon count and a vast amount of textures at
  interactive framerates is still a very challenging task, especially
  on mobile devices. This talk presents an approach for processing,
  caching and serving massive geospatial data in a cloud-based
  environment for large scale, out-of-core, highly scalable 3D scene
  rendering in a web-based solution. PyRT  is used for rendering large
  amounts of geospatial data. The approach for processing, rendering
  and caching 3D-City Models is shown.

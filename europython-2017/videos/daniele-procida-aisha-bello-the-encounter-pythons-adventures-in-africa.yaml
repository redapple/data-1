description: |-
  A genuine encounter changes both parties. In this talk Daniele and
  Aisha will report on the dialogue opened up by recent PyCons and
  other Python events in Africa. They’ll discuss Python’s impact in
  countries including Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and what
  open-source software means for Africa at large - and what the
  encounter means for Python too.

  In the last years climate change has become one of the most important
  topic. For any period longer than a few days science is not able to
  provide comparable forecasts, but still a lot of useful information
  about future climate conditions can be gained on time scale of a few
  months to even several years.

  Climate forecast and climate projections data are quite complex to
  analyse and represent. The Python science ecosystem proves extremely
  effective as a platform to retrieve, analyse, process and present
  this type of data. The backbone of the platform is the n-dimensional
  array library xarray that provides the perfect mix between pandas
  data structures and dask performance and parallelization.

  Reliable climate forecasts and climate projections are now available
  from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, operated by ECMWF, that
  will become the central hub for European effort in study and mitigate
  climate change impacts. The service also provides access to an open
  cloud platform, the CDS Toolbox, that is based on the Python 3
  xarray/dask/pandas stack.

  In this talk I will present how to retrieve, analyse, process and
  display climate data in a generic use case with xarray and with the
  Copernicus CDS Toolbox.

  "description": "Static analysis is a powerful technique for improving the quality of\nsoftware. It allows you to find bugs in your Python code without any\nthe need for any annotations.\n\nAt lgtm.com we provide state-of-the-art static analysis for a number\nof languages including Python. Our Python analysis can find bugs\nwithout the annoyance of many false positives. We have already found\nbugs in the standard library, requests, numpy and many others.\n\nIn this talk I will briefly describe what static analysis is, how it\ncan be useful to you, and then give an overview of the techniques we\nuse.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nThis talk is aimed at all Python developers, although I expect that\nthose who have used pyflakes, pep8, pylint or mypy in the past will\nfind it the most accessible. I hope that this talk will inspire\ndevelopers to start using static analysis tools (hopefully ours) and\nto produce better code as a result. I will assume that the audience\nknows Python well, but knows little or nothing about static analysis.\n\n(lgtm.com is a commercial project that is free to use for open-source software)",

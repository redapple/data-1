  The pandas library represents a very efficient and convenient tool
  for data manipulation, but sometimes hides unexpected pitfalls which
  can arise in various and sometimes unintelligible ways.

  By briefly referring to some aspects of the implementation, I will
  review specific situations in which a change of approach can make
  code based on pandas more robust, or more performant.

  Some examples:

  - inefficient indexing
  - multiple dtypes and efficiency
  - implicit type casting
  - HDF5 storage overhead
  - GroupBy.apply()... when you don't actually need it

  Authentication, authorization and public key infrastructure are
  complicated and hard to get right, yet crucial for every
  infrastructure. Manifold user databases in each application as well
  as ad-hoc self-signed TLS/SSL certificates don't scale and are hard
  to administrate. Users don't want to remember a password for each
  service, admins prefer a centralized PKI, and developers struggle
  with correct handling of password.

  FreeIPA is an Open Source, Python-based identity management solution.
  It is much more than a simple user database. FreeIPA combines
  multiple mature products under an easy-to-use installer, command line
  and web interface: 389-DS LDAP server, MIT Kerberos, Dogtag PKI
  certificate system, BIND DNS with DNSSEC, SSSD, certmonger and more.
  It provides identities for users, services and machines with single
  sign-on (optionally 2FA) and role or host based ACL. Keycloak and
  Ipsilon IdP can be integrated to offer OpenIDC or SAML. Mutual trust
  with Active Directory is possible, too.

  Installation of a FreeIPA server and integration with a WSGI
  application is much simpler than you might think.  At the end of my
  talk you will know how to deploy a FreeIPA server with just one
  command, how to add replicas for redundancy, how to authenticate
  users and access user data like name, email and group membership
  without adding a single line of Kerberos or LDAP code to your
  application, and how to issue TLS certificates with auto-renewal and
  OCSP.

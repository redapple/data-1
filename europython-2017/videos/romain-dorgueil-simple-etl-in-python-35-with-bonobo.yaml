  Simple is better than complex, right? That’s true for data pipelines too.

  For more than 5 years, I hacked together extract-transform-load (ETL)
  processes in various different positions (ETL is just a fancy term
  for «bunch of things that take data somewhere and put it elsewhere,
  eventually transformed»).

  I did it as a founder, as a consultant, as a technical co-founder,
  for some side projects, and now in a big corp (to be continued…).

  In each case, I felt frustrated with the tools available, and in some
  serious cases, I had to hack things myself to get the job done.

  Bonobo is the repackaging of my past experiences for python 3.5+, and
  grasping the basics should not take more than the length of the
  presentation.

  Topics outline (subject to small changes) :

  - INTRO : State of the art / different tools for different needs.
  - Where does it come from.
  - Writing a data processor.
  - Running and monitoring data jobs.
  - OUTRO : The road ahead.
  - Q&A

  Bonobo is the glue you need to tie together regular functions in a
  transformation graph (think unix pipes). Execution strategies are
  abstracted so you can focus on the real operations. As a result, you
  can engineer simple and testable systems, using the same good
  computer development practices as you use in -insert your favorite
  field here-.

  Spoiler : there is no «big data» in this talk.

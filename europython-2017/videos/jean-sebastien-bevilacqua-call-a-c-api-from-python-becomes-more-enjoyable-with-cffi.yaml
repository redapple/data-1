  Python is slow ! Python can’t access bare metal!

  You often hear theses assumptions? Theses limitations can be
  surpassed by Python extensions written in C. However, according to my
  personal experience, doing this by leveraging C may yield to several
  issues (e.g., memory management).

  C Foreign Function Interface for Python (a.k.a., CFFI) allows you to
  easily write Python extensions. One of the main aims of CFFI is to to
  wrap C libraries. Along the same lines, it may also be used for
  performance enhancement.

  By this call, I am firstly presenting CFFI and it’s two modes of
  utilization: API level and ABI level. Then I will share my own
  experience about wrapping `shaderc library
  <https://github.com/google/shaderc>`_ in six hours `pyshaderc
  <https://github.com/realitix/pyshaderc>`_.

  Next we are going to the next level, let’s wrap all the Vulkan API!
  Vulkan is the new 3D API and is not a piece of cake. To see the real
  advantage of CFFI, a side by side comparison between two Python
  modules is going to be presented:

  CVulkan is a Vulkan wrapper written fully in C, it’s a classic C
  extension for Python vulkan is its CFFI counterpart without any C
  written, only Python

  I have developed two versions of Vulkan wrapper (one in a pure C, and
  the second by leveraging CFFI) and I can assure you that CFFI is a a
  way better!

  Let’s code!

  We've all taken different routes to get to where we are today, and
  we're not all currently on the same road going the same place. Tracy
  Osborn will talk about the idea of the ""Python engineer,"" her (long
  and full of bumps and potholes) journey to learning and teaching
  Python, and the harmful myths about learning programming and the
  paths available when you do so.

  Static analysis is a powerful technique for improving the quality of
  software. It allows you to find bugs in your Python code without any
  the need for any annotations.

  At lgtm.com we provide state-of-the-art static analysis for a number
  of languages including Python. Our Python analysis can find bugs
  without the annoyance of many false positives. We have already found
  bugs in the standard library, requests, numpy and many others.

  In this talk I will briefly describe what static analysis is, how it
  can be useful to you, and then give an overview of the techniques we
  use.

  Intended Audience

  This talk is aimed at all Python developers, although I expect that
  those who have used pyflakes, pep8, pylint or mypy in the past will
  find it the most accessible. I hope that this talk will inspire
  developers to start using static analysis tools (hopefully ours) and
  to produce better code as a result. I will assume that the audience
  knows Python well, but knows little or nothing about static analysis.

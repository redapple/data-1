  "description": "Most of us have broadband internet services at home. Sometimes it\ndoes not work well, and we visit speed test page and check internet\nspeed for ourselves or call cable company to report the service\nfailure. As a Python programmer, have you ever tried to automate the\ninternet speed test on a regular basis? Have you ever thought about\nlogging the data and analyzing the time series ?\n\nIn this talk, we will go through the whole process of data mining and\nknowledge discovery. Firstly we write a script to run speed test\nperiodically and log the metric. Then we parse the log data and\nconvert them into a time series and visualize the data for a certain\nperiod.\n\nNext we conduct some data analysis; finding trends, forecasting, and\ndetecting anomalous data. There will be several statistic or deep\nlearning techniques used for the analysis; ARIMA (Autoregressive\nIntegrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).\n\nThe goal is to provide basic idea how to run speed test and collect\nmetrics by automated script in Python. Also, I will provide high\nlevel concept of the methodologies for analyzing time series data.\nAlso, I would like to motivate Python people to try this at home.\n\nThis session is designed to be accessible to everyone, including\nanyone with no expertise in mathematics, computer science.\nUnderstandings of basic concepts of machine learning and some Python\ntools bringing such concepts into practice might be helpful, but not\nnecessary for the audience.",

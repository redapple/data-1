  "description": "The Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) has been used to\nsupport learning in different scenarios, including taught courses,\nself-directed learning and reference material such as software\ndocumentation. People have used it to learn how to program, and to\nlearn about diverse subjects where computer code is important to\nhuman understanding. The aim of this talk is to dive into where and\nhow notebooks can be used most effectively for education.\n\nI will first describe notebook-based learning material created by a\nvariety of people for different purposes, deliberately taking a broad\ndefinition of \u2018education\u2019, along with my own experiences using\nnotebooks to teach Software Carpentry sessions and conference\ntutorials. I\u2019ll pull out both strengths and limitations of notebooks\nas an educational tool to explore how they can be used most\neffectively.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I\u2019ll talk about several extra\nsoftware tools which can make the notebook more valuable in\neducational settings, including Jupyterhub, with which a teacher can\nprovide notebook servers for a group of students, nbgrader, which\nallows notebooks to be used as assignments, and cite2c, which can\ninsert academic citations into notebooks. I\u2019ll also touch on\ncommercial offerings integrating the notebook, such as SageMathCloud.",

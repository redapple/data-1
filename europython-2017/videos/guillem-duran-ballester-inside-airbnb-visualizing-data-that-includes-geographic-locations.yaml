  This talk is about creating visualizations for data that includes
  geographical locations. We will be using data from InsideAirbnb.com
  to represent the current status of Airbnb listings in Mallorca.

  We will show practical examples of different visualizations of geographical data:

  First, we will start with how to use bokeh to overlay data on google
  maps. We will use examples to show how the GMapPlot interface works.
  We will briefly explain how to use it,  and what are its limitations.

  Then, we will talk about plotting shapefiles with holoviews.
  Shapefiles are files that describe the shape of maps. We will explain
  how to deal with shapefiles. For instance, we will describe how we
  use shapefiles to group geographical data by regions. We will also
  briefly explain how holoviews works and how it can be used to display
  geographical data.

  Moreover, we will talk about using datashader and geoviews to
  visualize big data. First, we will briefly introduce datashader, bin
  based plotting and the datashader Pipeline. After that, we will show
  how to create plots with geoviews: how is the Interface, a few use
  cases and some examples. Finally, we will move to plotting big data
  on interactive maps.

  Eventually we will finish with dynamic maps for visualizing time
  series: we will explain how do we do it and show some examples of how
  to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing geographical data
  that varies over time.

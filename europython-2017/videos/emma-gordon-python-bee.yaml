  Thought up in 2009 by a group of MIT students who entered the Python
  bee into a competition for “bad ideas”, a Python bee is like a
  spelling bee for programmers.

  Instead of spelling words, participants are given functions to write
  and must spell them out loud - one character at a time, without
  looking at the code that they're writing! Players must spell valid
  Python and every character counts, including symbols and whitespace.

  And the twist for the second round (credit for this one goes to
  dropboxblogs):

  You're now allowed to look at the code, but... you must now team up
  with other programmers, entering alternate characters without being
  allowed to communicate via any other means.

  In order for everyone to be able to have a go, we'll split up into
  small groups to play - for those that want to be competitive, we'll
  use a scoring system so that we can still declare an overall
  champion. You're very welcome to come along just to have fun though!

  TL;DR - a fun hour of slightly ridiculous programming games :)

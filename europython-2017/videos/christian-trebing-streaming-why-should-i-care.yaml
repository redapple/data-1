  You think, all that hype about streaming solutions does not affect
  you? I thought so also. But when playing around with that topic for
  some time, I realized that it sheds a different light on many topics
  I struggled with for some time. In this talk I want to share with you
  what I discovered when switching from a from a database centric view
  to stream oriented processing.

  Splitting your application in smaller services gets easier as you
  have more natural boundaries. You have more options to run different
  data schema versions in different services (instead of one central db
  upgrade). More scaling possibilities. Operations improvements.

  For sure, streaming does not solve any problem, but much more than I
  thought before. And in python you have good support with many
  streaming clients. I will give some examples and comparisons for
  working with Kafka and Avro Schemas.

  This interactive game teaches is the follow-up of the Router Game by
  Roberto Polli, and teaches various TCP / IP protocols using paper and
  pen.

  Participants are divided in teams, simulating exchanges through
  various protocols (DNS, TCP, IP)

  Every player has an L3 role: a PC or mobile phone, a Router, a Load
  Balancer ... and must communicate with the others following the
  associate specification (eg. a TCP client may buffer frames, a Load
  Balancer re-encapsulates IP datagram, ... )

  The team which is faster in exhanging messages wins.

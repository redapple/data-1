  "description": "Unreal Engine is the game industry leading platform for developing\nAAA Videogames. Now you can script your gameplay logic, automate your\ndevelopment pipelines or test your productions with Python too. The\nUnrealEnginePython plugin aims at covering the whole feature set of\nUnreal Engine 4 and extending it with the huge modules library\navailable in the Python world.\n\nThe talk will briefly introduce the Unreal Engine platform and its\ncapabilities as well as how it can be programmed without the python\nplugin (Blueprints and C++).\n\nThe biggest part of the talk will focus on how the Unreal Engine 4\npatterns are mapped to the python plugin, what is already working and\nwhat you can expect from future developments.\n\nNo prior knowledge of game/graphics programming is required,  and if\nyou are in the movie or cartoon industry you can get interesting\ninfos too",

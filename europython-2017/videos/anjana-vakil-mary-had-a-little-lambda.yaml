      Mary had a little lambda,
      a function pure as snow.
      And for every program that Mary wrote,
      the lambda was all she needed to know.

  Python’s lambda, a tiny anonymous function, can be useful in a pinch
  when you’re feeling too lazy to type that extra d-e-f.
  But did you know that behind this little lambda is actually
  one of the most powerful &amp; elegant abstractions in the
  history of computer science?

  The lambda calculus, dating back to the work of lambda shepherd
  Alonzo Church in the 1930's, lets us represent our programs
  - all their logic and data - as pure, anonymous functions,
  using nothing but (a whole lot of) lambda. Let’s take it for
  a spin and see what we can create: booleans and conditionals,
  integers, arithmetical operators, data structures… you name it.
  With some determination, and a little squinting, we might even see
  lambda do the impossible: reconcile object-oriented and functional
  programming. You heard it right: lambda can do it all!

  Join me as we explore its astounding computational power,
  and walk away with a deeper respect and admiration
  for the almighty little lambda.

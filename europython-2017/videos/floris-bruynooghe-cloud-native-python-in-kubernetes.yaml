  Serverside applications are more and more likely to need to run in
  dynamic cloud environments where they can automatically scale as
  required.  One rightfully popular approach is to run the application
  as a Docker container inside a Kubernetes cluster, giving you a lot of
  operational benefits thanks to the Kubernetes folks.

  For the most part it is rather easy to make your Python application
  work inside a Docker container.  But there are a number of common
  patterns one can follow to save time by delegating more things to the
  runtime environment.  Furthermore you can start adding a few simple
  non-intrusive features to your application which will help improve the
  application live-cycle in the cluster, ensuring smooth hand-over when
  migrating the container to different nodes or scaling it up or down.

  This talk will quickly cover the basics of Kubernetes and will then
  start from a simple program and will discuss the steps to take to make
  it behave well in this environment.  Starting with the basics steps
  you can rely on the runtime for, covering logging and all the way to
  supporting the service life-cycle, health checking and monitoring in a
  Kubernetes environment.  You will see that building a cloud-native
  application is not very hard and something you can gradually
  introduce.

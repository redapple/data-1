  SAP operates one of the largest test infrastructure to test its
  in-memory database SAP HANA. The infrastructure provides different
  services like continues integration, code coverage and code linting
  for a huge C++ project with Python test coding. These services are
  essential for the development teams and quality specialists. Without
  these services developing and shipping of new SAP HANA version
  wouldn’t be possible.

  In 2010, we started with a single Jenkins master with ten nodes. But
  to keep our testing time acceptable for the growing number of
  developers we had to scale up and that led to multiple different
  scaling challenges. The current test infrastructure is powered by
  more than thousand physical servers. Scaling of the infrastructure
  was only possible with custom optimizations like improved scheduling,
  expressive test configuration and robust tooling implemented in our
  favorite language Python. With the flexibility and power of Python
  it’s possible for developers to implement complex test scenarios to
  verify features and mitigate regressions. On infrastructure side, it
  has been easier to extend, optimize and adapt the infrastructure for
  new requirements like different CPU architectures and newer Operating
  systems versions.

  This talk provides insights and stories how we scaled and improved
  our test infrastructure and how new technologies like Linux
  Containers can improve automated testing and software quality
  assurance.

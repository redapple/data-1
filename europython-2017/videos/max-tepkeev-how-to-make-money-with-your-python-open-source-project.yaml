  Developers create new open-source projects every day. As the project
  becomes popular they have to invest more and more time into it's
  development and of course at some point a question arises: ""How can
  I make some money with my project ?""

  In this talk we will try to answer this question. We will talk about
  different models of making money, their pros and cons. We will
  concentrate on Python Open-Source projects mostly and try to answer
  the following questions:

  - What to sell?
  - Where to sell?
  - How to distribute?
  - How to license?

  After this talk you will have a clear understanding of how you can
  make money with your project. What your next steps should be and how
  you can get the actual profit while still continuing making your
  customers happy.

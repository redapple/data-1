  This talk is for general public with problems to scale. The good
  background for this talk is people with minimal knowledge about
  threads. After this talk I expect that the audience can be enable to
  understand multiprocessing, when use and which tools and methods are
  appropriate for each case.

  Understanding threads

  - It's the first moment on the talk. Here I'll speak about the thread theory and what happen when we use threads on the OS

  Threads and multiprocess API

  - I'll give simple examples about what python give us to use threads and multiprocessing perhaps with two APIs

    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html
    - https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/multiprocessing.html

  Understanding Green threads

  - Here I'll speak about green threads theory and what happen when we use green threads on our OS

  Green thread Patterns and tools

  - Here I'll show few examples with keep alive patterns, discuss about a few tools and show gevent and asyncio examples

  Parallelism x asynchronism

  - I'll show the diference between parallelism and asynchronism discussing about the two theories

  Why, when and how

  - It's is the last talk moment and I'll explain the how complex is work with multiprocess showing cases like queues consume and APIs consume

  No matter whether you run a web app, search for gravitational waves,
  or maintain a backup script: being responsible for a piece of
  software or infrastructure means that you either get a pager right
  away, or that you get angry calls from people affected by outages.
  Being paged at 4am in everyday life is bad enough. Having to fix
  problems from hotel rooms while your travel buddies go for brunch is
  even worse.

  And while incidents canâ€™t be prevented completely, there are ways to
  make your systems more reliable and minimize the need for (your!)
  manual intervention. This talk will help you to get calm nights and
  relaxing vacations by teaching you some of them.

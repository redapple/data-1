  Python is full of amazing (yet often overlooked) features, that can
  help us write better, cleaner, and more maintainable code. One of
  them is the descriptors interface.

  By means of descriptors, we can run code when accessing or setting
  properties of another object. This can have a lot of applications,
  and keeping descriptors in mind might come in handy when facing a
  hard problem.

  The goal of the talk is to explore descriptors, and how they can be
  written, as well as analysing some interesting examples in well-known
  libraries or projects in order to identify scenarios where
  descriptors are the Pythonic way to go.

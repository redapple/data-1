  Compiling source code into libraries and executables has always been
  problematic, especially for cross platform projects. Typical problems
  in existing build systems include slow build times, undecipherable
  syntax, lack of support for cross compilation and so on. Some people
  choose to not use a build system at all but instead just write a
  one-off Makefile, which will usually work fine on their machine and
  nowhere else. All this makes software development slower than it
  needs to be.

  The Meson build system (http://mesonbuild.com) is a new build system
  designed from the ground up to provide a solution for these (and
  other) problems. It is implemented in Python 3 and provides a simple,
  non-Turing complete DSL for describing the build. The project
  provides built-in support for common tasks such as documentation
  generation, building Qt apps and Python extension modules. Meson is
  currently seeing a lot of uptake in the Free software world with big
  projects such as GStreamer, parts of GNOME, Wayland and even the X
  server either transitioning, or very strongly considering the
  transition to Meson.

  In this talk we go over the design of Meson, how to use it for new
  and existing projects and the benefits this brings, including faster
  compiles, less time wasted debugging the build system environment and
  easy access to modern software development tools and practices.

  "description": "A year ago we decided to use Django and, specifically, DRF as the\ncornerstone of our upcoming fast-iterating web platform. In this talk\nI discuss why and how the architecture has evolved, key decisions\nmade and the lessons we learned along the way.\n\nI'll share the techniques we used for iterating quickly and how the\ntechnology supported (and shaped) them. In addition some quirks and\nDRF-specific tricks will be brought along the way.\n\nExpect a general talk about how Python (and specifically DRF) can be\nused as a based for quick product iterations, a discussion regarding\nhow to build and evolve a platform to meet those needs and some\nDRF-specific tidbits. No previous knowledge is required but\nexperience in web development will make the content more accessible.",

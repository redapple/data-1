  Python has grown in both significance and popularity in the last
  years, especially in the field of high performance computing and
  machine learning. When it comes to performance, there are numerous
  ways of profiling and measuring code performance—with each analysis
  tool having its own strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, we will
  introduce a rich GUI application (Intel® VTune™ Amplifier) which can
  be used to analyze the runtime performance of one’s Python
  application, and fully understand where the performance bottlenecks
  are in one’s code.  With this application, one may also analyze the
  call-stacks and get quick visual clues where one’s Python application
  is spending time or wasting CPU cycles.

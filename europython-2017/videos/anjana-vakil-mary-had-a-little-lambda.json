  "description": "::\n    Mary had a little lambda,\n    a function pure as snow.\n    And for every program that Mary wrote,\n    the lambda was all she needed to know.\n\nPython\u2019s lambda, a tiny anonymous function, can be useful in a pinch\nwhen you\u2019re feeling too lazy to type that extra d-e-f.\nBut did you know that behind this little lambda is actually\none of the most powerful &amp; elegant abstractions in the\nhistory of computer science?\n\nThe lambda calculus, dating back to the work of lambda shepherd\nAlonzo Church in the 1930's, lets us represent our programs\n- all their logic and data - as pure, anonymous functions,\nusing nothing but (a whole lot of) lambda. Let\u2019s take it for\na spin and see what we can create: booleans and conditionals,\nintegers, arithmetical operators, data structures\u2026 you name it.\nWith some determination, and a little squinting, we might even see\nlambda do the impossible: reconcile object-oriented and functional\nprogramming. You heard it right: lambda can do it all!\n\nJoin me as we explore its astounding computational power,\nand walk away with a deeper respect and admiration\nfor the almighty little lambda.",

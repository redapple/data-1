  "description": "This talk is about creating visualizations for data that includes\ngeographical locations. We will be using data from InsideAirbnb.com\nto represent the current status of Airbnb listings in Mallorca.\n\nWe will show practical examples of different visualizations of geographical data:\n\nFirst, we will start with how to use bokeh to overlay data on google\nmaps. We will use examples to show how the GMapPlot interface works.\nWe will briefly explain how to use it,  and what are its limitations.\n\nThen, we will talk about plotting shapefiles with holoviews.\nShapefiles are files that describe the shape of maps. We will explain\nhow to deal with shapefiles. For instance, we will describe how we\nuse shapefiles to group geographical data by regions. We will also\nbriefly explain how holoviews works and how it can be used to display\ngeographical data.\n\nMoreover, we will talk about using datashader and geoviews to\nvisualize big data. First, we will briefly introduce datashader, bin\nbased plotting and the datashader Pipeline. After that, we will show\nhow to create plots with geoviews: how is the Interface, a few use\ncases and some examples. Finally, we will move to plotting big data\non interactive maps.\n\nEventually we will finish with dynamic maps for visualizing time\nseries: we will explain how do we do it and show some examples of how\nto build an interactive dashboard for visualizing geographical data\nthat varies over time.",

  A global atmospheric model play an important role in short-term
  weather forecasting and long-term climate prediction. The model
  requires enormous computing resources because the all atmospheric
  states must be calculated every time step (usually a tens of seconds
  to several minutes). However, since the most atmospheric models run
  only on CPU machines, they are not able to use the modern
  microprocessors with high performance and low power such as NVIDIA
  GPU and Intel MIC.

  It often costs a lot to convert codes from one machine to the other
  machine.  Although it can be accelerated on GPU and MIC using OpenMP
  and OpenACC directives, it is not easy to achieve peak performance. I
  developed a new Python module named PyMIP (Python based Machine
  Independent Platform) to integrate C, Fortran, CUDA and OpenCL codes
  with a simple user interface. The main code includes configuration,
  flow control, IO and MPI parallel is written by Python. Only hotspots
  include huge number crunching code are written by compile language as
  C, Fortran, CUDA and OpenCL. The hotspot codes are compiled and
  imported using PyMIP in runtime. PyMIP enables that a user can switch
  machines with simple flag.

  I am developing a new global atmospheric model based on PyMIP to make
  it easy to utilize various modern microprocessors.  In this
  presentation, I will introduce PyMIP and show the computational
  performance result in NVIDIA GPU of the dynamical core of the model
  developed based on PyMIP.

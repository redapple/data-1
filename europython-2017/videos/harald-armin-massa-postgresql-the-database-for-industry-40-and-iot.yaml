  Industry 4.0 - the current trend to make more use of data technology
  and analysis in manufactring.

  IOT - The Internet of Things, where many ""things"" currently just
  loosing their information will transfer and store them within central
  systems.

  There are aspects of those trends most do agree on:

  - There will be orders of magnitude more data to store and analyze.
  - More agents will need to connect and interact with databases.

  This talk will explore what makes PostgreSQL an excellent candidate
  to be the database for managing all that data. Strengths in
  development,  culture and community, extensibility and robustnest
  will be presented. Selected features of current Version 9.6 and the
  soon-to-be-released PostgreSQL Version 10 will be discussed for their
  value in those trends. There will be an explanation of their
  technical realisation, and special pointers how to use those features
  from PostgreSQL.

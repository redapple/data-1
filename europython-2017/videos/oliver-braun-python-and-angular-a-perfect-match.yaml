  Python on mobile devices is still negligible mostly because of the
  GUI problems which arise. But Python on android devices is considered
  to be a solved problem since the module Python for Android is
  available. We have nowadays at least the possibility to develop for
  mobile devices with the GUI engine Kivy which is maybe the first
  choice for rapid prototyping on that platform. But as it comes to
  design work and mobile device look alike Kivy is still far behind the
  web development tools HTML/CSS.

  In our talk we present a conceptual work where we used Ionic - this
  is an mobile development framework based on Angular - to build the
  GUI part of an app and connected that to a Python back end. In our
  point of view our proposal is very general and will give Python a
  boost towards modern UX development and makes HTML/CSS/JavaScript a
  real option especially in combination with Angular.

  The main part of our solution that we show is the interoperation
  between JavaScript and Python such that asynchronous calls in both
  direction are possible.

  The advantage is to develop UX and back end code only once and use it
  literally on every platform where a Python interpreter and a browser
  runs.

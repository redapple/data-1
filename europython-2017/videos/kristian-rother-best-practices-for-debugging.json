  "description": "Debugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is\nassumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have\nto deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial\nattempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and\ncorresponding programming techniques.\n\nIn this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for\nsystematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a\nseries of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with\nincreasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining\none-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in\nan entertaining way.\n\nContents:\n\n- Syntax Error against Runtime exceptions\n- Get file and directory names right\n- Debugging with the scientific method\n- Inspection of variables with print and introspection functions\n- Using an interactive debugger\n- Pros and cons of ``try.. except``\n- Delta debugging",

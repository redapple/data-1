  Airflow is a powerful system to schedule workflows and define them as
  a collection of interdependent scripts. It is the perfect companion
  to do extract/transform/load pipelines into data warehouses, such as
  Redshift.

  This talk will introduce some of the basis of Airflow and some of the
  concepts that are data pipeline specific, like backfills, retries,
  etc. Then there will be some examples on how to integrate this, along
  with some lessons learned there.

  At the end, there will be a part dedicated to Redshift, how to
  structure data there, how to do some basic transformation
  pre-loading, how to manage the schema using SQLAlchemy and Alembic.

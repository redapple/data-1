  "description": "High-energy particles accelerated by the Sun during Coronal Mass\nEjections (CME) are a major concern for a manned mission to Mars. On\nEarth surface, these particles are shielded by the Earth magnetic\nfield. In space and on the Martian surface, where such shielding is\nabsent or much weaker, CME pose a radiation hazard to the health of\nastronauts. The development of tools to understand and forecast the\ninterplanetary space weather is a requirement for future manned space\nmissions in order to properly protect the astronauts from the\nradiation environment. A variety of methods are currently developed\nby the scientific community and a number of public tools for space\nweather monitoring and forecast is already available online.\n\nWe present a Python-based tool which takes advantage of two publicly\naccessible space weather web portals. Our software combines the\nforecast of CME and a real-time propagation model of energetic\nparticles throughout the inner Solar System and the Martian\natmosphere. It consistently recovers real-time relevant information\nand provides with days-to-hours forecasts for the radiation dose\nastronauts on Mars would be exposed to. The system raises an alert\nsignal when the radiation dose exceeds the security levels defined by\nthe main space agencies adopted as a reference. Our tool is meant to\nbe integrated in a virtual reality simulation of a human settlement\non the surface of Mars (Mars City Project www.mars-city.org).\n\nPrerequisite:  Intermediate knowledge.",

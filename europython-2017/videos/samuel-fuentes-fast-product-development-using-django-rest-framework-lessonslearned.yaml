  A year ago we decided to use Django and, specifically, DRF as the
  cornerstone of our upcoming fast-iterating web platform. In this talk
  I discuss why and how the architecture has evolved, key decisions
  made and the lessons we learned along the way.

  I'll share the techniques we used for iterating quickly and how the
  technology supported (and shaped) them. In addition some quirks and
  DRF-specific tricks will be brought along the way.

  Expect a general talk about how Python (and specifically DRF) can be
  used as a based for quick product iterations, a discussion regarding
  how to build and evolve a platform to meet those needs and some
  DRF-specific tidbits. No previous knowledge is required but
  experience in web development will make the content more accessible.

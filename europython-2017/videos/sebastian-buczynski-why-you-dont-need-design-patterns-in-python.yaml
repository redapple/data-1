  Exactly 23 years have passed since release of one of the biggest IT
  classics - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
  Software".

  Contents of the book had considerable influence on dominant
  programming languages of those days. However, design patterns were
  not glorified by everyone. Voices of rational critic appeared,
  pointing out that design patterns are just ways to compensate for
  missing languages features by tons of clumsy code. If one implements
  design patterns in Python by the book, they will get code that looks
  awkward, at best.

  This talk is to present Python's features that either simplifies or
  eliminates need for implementing design patterns. Even if you don't
  know what design patterns are - don't worry. You still may see some
  new interesting Python's features and their usage.

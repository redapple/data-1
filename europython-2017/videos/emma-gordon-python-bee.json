  "description": "Thought up in 2009 by a group of MIT students who entered the Python\nbee into a competition for \u201cbad ideas\u201d, a Python bee is like a\nspelling bee for programmers.\n\nInstead of spelling words, participants are given functions to write\nand must spell them out loud - one character at a time, without\nlooking at the code that they're writing! Players must spell valid\nPython and every character counts, including symbols and whitespace.\n\nAnd the twist for the second round (credit for this one goes to\ndropboxblogs):\n\nYou're now allowed to look at the code, but... you must now team up\nwith other programmers, entering alternate characters without being\nallowed to communicate via any other means.\n\nIn order for everyone to be able to have a go, we'll split up into\nsmall groups to play - for those that want to be competitive, we'll\nuse a scoring system so that we can still declare an overall\nchampion. You're very welcome to come along just to have fun though!\n\nTL;DR - a fun hour of slightly ridiculous programming games :)",

  Cython is not only an excellent and widely used tool to speed up
  computational Python code, itâ€™s also a very smart way to talk to
  native code and libraries. The Cython compiler translates Python code
  to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow
  direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. You get the best of
  both worlds while working with Cython: Python like syntax with
  blazing fast C speed.

  This talk/tutorial by a Python/Cython developer introduces Cython
  programming language and leads the participants all the way from
  their first Python extension to an efficient integration with native
  C.

  Topics covered will be:

  1. Using the Cython compiler to build a native extension module
  2. Cython development from Jupyter notebook
  3. Mixing Python with static C types in the Cython language
  4. Calling into native code from Cython code (Brief introduction)
  5. Wrap up: A brief case study -
     Cyvlfeat: A Cython/Python wrapper for Computer Vision library, VLFeat.

  Participants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python
  language, some basic knowledge about C or C++.  No deep C programming
  knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about
  writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.

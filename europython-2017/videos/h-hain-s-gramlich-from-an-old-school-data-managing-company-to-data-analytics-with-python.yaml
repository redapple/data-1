  Our mission is to manage a huge amount of communication and document
  data in large scale industry projects by providing web based project
  management systems. The increasing amount of communication creates
  the desire for a GPS helping us and our customers to navigate through
  the communication stream. Our R&amp;D projects are focusing on topics
  like clustering, event detection, and network analysis (Who knows
  who, domain experts).

  Traveling the wild side of NLP, Data Science, and Analytics, we
  stumbled across amazing Python tools supporting us in our goal to
  navigate the project communication and therefor supporting our
  clients in Project &amp; Risk Management avoiding wrong turns. We
  would like to share some of our approaches to answer our research
  topics and challenges:

  One of the challenges, amongst others, is to utilize and adapt up to
  date clustering algorithms for social stream data and to expose them
  as reentrant services. Another one is to tailor them for the current
  application domain, improving clustering precision by parametrization
  and other means. Furthermore the integration of a Python based
  analytics system into an existing JAVA based application environment
  and eco system is required.

  In addition, we would also like to share some of our ""traffic jams""
  experienced during our travel starting as traditional Java/SQL
  focusing company that integrated Python into its development
  portfolio.

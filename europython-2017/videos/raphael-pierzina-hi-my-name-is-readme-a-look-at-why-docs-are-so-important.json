  "description": "When starting a new project, as developers we usually get right into\nhacking things, like tinkering with libs that we would like to learn\nor solving a particular problem as quickly a possible. Occasionally\nwe also decide to publish the resulting package to PyPI, so that\nothers can use our nifty code, submit a pull request and maybe even\nform a community around the project.\n\nIf you're lucky someone might find it on the front-page of PyPI or\nthe GitHub search or maybe even Hacker News or Reddit. What happens\nnext is on you really.  But what does that mean?\n\nBefore jumping right to the command line and installing your package,\nthose who are interested usually try to find out what problems the\nproject is solving and how it can help them with their own. That's\nwhat your README file is for - it's most likely the first thing\npotential users read, that you control.\n\nA good README briefly and concisely explains what your software does,\nhow it can be installed and what API it exposes. You also want to\nprovide information on the requirements, the license it uses and how\nthe project is managed. Who are you? How to get in touch to report\nproblems and give feedback? Where can I find the Code of Conduct for\nthis project?\n\nThis talk is for everyone who is interested in working on open source\nprojects and wants to know how documentation can help newcomers and\nmore experienced users use your code and to encourage them to engage\nin the community.",

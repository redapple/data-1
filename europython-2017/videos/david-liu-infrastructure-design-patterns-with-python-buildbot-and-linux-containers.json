  "description": "In today\u2019s world of fast-paced development, infrastructure can get\nleft behind quickly, leading to a potential increase in technical\ndebt. Buildbot is normally known to be a continuous integration (CI)\nframework built in Python, but can be refashioned to solve\ninfrastructure design patterns that arise in enterprise or production\nand deployment situations. Using Python and native Buildbot\ncomponents paired with Linux Containers, patterns such as license\nmanagement, resource allocation, load balancing, and enterprise\napplication deployment can be architected quickly with room for\nexpansion as one\u2019s needs grow.\n\nLearn how to move past the CI mindset and construct infrastructure\nneeds with Buildbot and popular Linux Containers such as Docker and\nClearContainers. Attendees will learn the best known methods of\nconfiguring Buildbot in non-CI implementations, and how to utilize\nthe framework components for future needs.",

  For Python development, we mainly focus on IDE, browser and sometimes
  a command line. I want to focus on command line tools which seem to
  be a bit forgotten these days. Let me show a few tools I'm using on
  daily basis and how they helped me become more productive. I'll prove
  it's possible to start up a new environment from scratch that feels
  like $HOME. Finally, I want to convince you how important it is to
  constantly challenge yourself and your tools, how useful is a custom
  toolbox tailored to you.

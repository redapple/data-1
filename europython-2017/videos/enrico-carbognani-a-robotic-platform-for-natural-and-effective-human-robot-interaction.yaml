  This  talk deals  with  the usage  of  artificial  intelligent
  techniques  in  humanoid  robotics. The focus is on humanâ€“robot
  interaction with the goal of building a robotic platform which
  embodiments are able to interact in natural and effective way with
  humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions. The system
  is fully implemented in Python and based on the Robotic Operating
  System (ROS). The talk will describe the hardware and software
  configuration of our currently NAO based humanoid platform.  The
  strategy has been to use available high level Python libraries for
  spoken language processing, sentiment analysis,  vision,  interfacing
  with Artificial Intelligence applications  in   order   to   provide
  current edge technologies performances.   The overall system
  architecture is based on finite state machines nodes interacting via
  the ROS communication layer.

  The main fields of applications that the platform is targeting are:

  - Entertainment
  - Education
  - Field robotics
  - Home and companion robotics
  - Hospitality
  - Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT)

  We will present the latest status of the platform together with a NAO based demo.

  "description": "There are as many different ways to package an application as there\nare programming or scripting languages. No one tool or library is in\nitself better than another; however when security comes into the\npicture, there is definitely a pattern between ease of installation\nand how secure the delivered application is. As more work is put into\npackaging the application, more measures can be taken in order to\nensure its integrity and prevent security issues.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n- The roles involved in the lifecycle of an application, from the\n  start of the development process until it reaches the end user and it\n  is actually used.\n- The inherent problems in this subject, regarding installation and\n  security, as well as how they are related.\n- The different ways of packaging an application in order to deliver\n  it to an end user, focused on a Python perspective.\n\nAfter the talk, attendees will have a better grasp on which is the\nbest way for them to package and deliver their application according\nto their environment and target audience. They will also learn about\nthe upgrade path to switch from one delivery method to another,\nshould they need or want to.\n\nFor this talk, it is desired that attendees have some general systems\nknowledge. Even though the talk will be focused on Python\napplications, some knowledge of information security is desired.",

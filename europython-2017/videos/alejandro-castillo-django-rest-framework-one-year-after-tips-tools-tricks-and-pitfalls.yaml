description: |-
  One year ago we started OnTruck. Our CTO had previously had some success
  with DRF so after discussing it, we decided to give it a try.
  After a year building a quickly iterating startup on top of Django Rest Framework,
  we have reflected a lot on it. Even now, with a full year of development
  on top of it, we still periodically discuss going forward or dropping it.
  For the time being it still wins. So we think we have learned a lot about it.

  This talk is a walkthrough of the discoveries & learnings we have made
  at OnTruck during that year.
  We will cover different aspects of the framework, what advantages
  it has given us and also what tradeoffs it has forced.

  We will discuss both how it relates to Django on the inside and how it
  relates with other systems outside. We will approach it both from
  a purely user perspective and also discuss some of its internals
  and the way we tweaked them to make it work for us.

  We will cover the pitfalls we have both avoided and fallen into.
  The tricks that have helped us keep our speed and sanity.
  The tools we have both used and discarded on the way.

  And finally the tips we would give ourselves if we were starting all
  over again after this year.

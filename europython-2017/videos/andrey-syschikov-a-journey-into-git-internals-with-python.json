  "description": "Despite 12 years of history and wide popularity the workings of\nGit still remain largely a mystery for many.\nA lot of Git users operate it just by remembering a bunch of commands\nand repeating them in a correct order.\nI was one of them until I decided to dig deeper into how Git actually\nworks and suddenly I understood that internally Git operates by rather\nsimple principles and after you figure them out suddenly all those\ncommands start to make sense.\n\nTo look into the Git's internal structure you need a programming language\nto crunch the data and Python fit perfectly for this task.\n\nIn this talk, I will dig into the internals of Git with Python,\nthat will help you better understand how Git works.",

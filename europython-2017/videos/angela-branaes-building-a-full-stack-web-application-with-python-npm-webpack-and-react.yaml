  Creating full-stack applications with Python, NodeJS and React can seem
  daunting at first. Having made many variations of these,
  I will show you the ropes, so you too can discover that it is in fact
  easy to get going.

  In this talk you will learn to create a full-stack web application in
  Python, with a Nodejs and React front-end.
  I will provide you with an easy-to- follow walkthrough of the process,
  and youâ€™ll exit this talk feeling confident that you can now create
  your own full-stack web application.

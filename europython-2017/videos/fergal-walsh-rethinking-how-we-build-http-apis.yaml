  The Python universe is overflowing with web frameworks, from full
  featured batteries included frameworks like Django to micro
  frameworks like Bottle or Flask. They each have their own specific
  features but in the end they are all very similar in their core
  functionality of processing requests and generating responses.

  In this talk I will discuss why I felt the need to create yet another
  framework, a pico framework, that specifically focuses on the task of
  building HTTP based APIs for the web.

  Pico, as it is aptly called, doesn't do templating, ORM, custom
  routing, authentication, validation, caching, or a million other
  things. Instead it helps you write clean APIs using simple functions
  and modules with minimal boilerplate. Pico is both opinionated and
  flexible in equal measures so you can focus on what matters; your API
  logic. Pico helps you to write code that that is simple to get
  started, trivial to test, and easy to maintain as your project grows.

  APIs built with Pico are self describing so client code can
  automatically/dynamically be created. Pico includes both a Python
  &amp; Javascript client but it is also very simple to interact with
  your API with plain old cURL/Requests/jQuery/etc. It is just a HTTP
  API after all.

  Having recently released Pico 2.0, this talk will outline the
  evolution of this framework over the past 7 years and discuss some
  lessons learnt along the way about building HTTP APIs and frameworks.

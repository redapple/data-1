  "description": "Deep learning is at its peak, with scholars and startups releasing\nnew amazing applications every other week, and TensorFlow is the main\ntool to work with it. However, Tensorflow it's not an easy-access library for beginners in the field.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover the explanation of core concepts of deep\nlearning and TensorFlow totally from scratch, using simple examples\nand friendly visualizations.\n\nThe talk will go through the next topics:\n\n- Why deep learning and what is it?\n- The main tool for deep learning: TensorFlow\n- Installation of TensorFlow\n- Core concepts of TensorFlow: Graph and Session\n- Hello world!\n- Step by step example: learning how to sum\n- Core concepts of Deep Learning: Neural network\n- Core concepts of Deep Learning: Loss function and Gradient descent\n\nBy the end of this talk, the hope is that you will have gained the\nbasic concepts involving deep learning and that you could build and\nrun your own neural networks using TensorFlow.",

  "description": "Why should a Python programmer be interested in Bitcoin and the\nBlockchain technology?\n\nBlockchain technology is one of the fastest moving part in the\nFintech area. However, the Blockchain is not only the basis of crypto\ncurrencies. First of all it\u2019s a decentralized registry that cannot be\nmodified. This means that using a Blockchain, users can trust in the\nvalidity of a dataset without the need to establish a central\nauthority. Thus, the Blockchain can be used to store records e.g. of\nland ownership or and other property rights in countries with weak or\ncorrupt or otherwise incompetent authorities.\n\nTherefore, Python programmers with an understanding of this\ntechnology are especially well prepared to contribute in this area,\nbecause the agility inherent to Python makes it easy to program in a\nfast moving environment. The fact that various applications in the\nBitcoin and Blockchain area are implemented in Python prove this\nnotion. However, the reverse is also true: An understanding of the\ndistributed ledger technology possibly enables you to solve problems\nin projects you encounter in the near future.\n\nIn this talk, I will present the following topics:\n\n-   The Blockchain architecture: nodes, transactions, headers.\n-   The Bitcoin protocol and its proof of work (POW)\n-   Smart contracts\n-   Bitcoin alternatives: Proof-of-work (PoW) compared to Proof-of-stake (PoS)",

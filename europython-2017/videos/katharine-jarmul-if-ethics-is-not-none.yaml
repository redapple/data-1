  The history of computing, as it's often covered in textbooks or
  talks, remains primarily focused on a series of hardware
  advancements, architectures, operating systems and software. In this
  talk, we will instead explore the history of ethics in computing,
  touching on the early days of computers in warfare and science,
  leading up to ethical issues today such as Artificial Intelligence
  and privacy regulation.

  Number of libraries for building RESTful web applications is growing
  up. Selecting best framework becomes hard decision for web
  developers.

  During the presentation I will go through best libraries I can
  recommend for building RESTful web applications.

  Selection of libraries will be subjective, based on my experience
  with building microservices in Python. I will share code examples,
  weaknesses and strengths for each library. I hope everyone will find
  something that best suits his needs.

  In this talk about using Selenium and Python for social media
  automation you will get some insights into growing your own open
  source projects into tools that really get used and maintained by a
  community. You will get an idea of what pitfalls you have to face
  when working with something as fast changing as Instagram and how to
  best tackle this.

  You'll  learn what the ""Page Object"" design pattern is, what it is
  useful for and why we use it.

  Of course we will also talk about OpenSource and why it's important.

  A lot of the talk will be based on my article on InstaPy published at
  the freeCodeCamp publication on Medium:
  https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-open-source-instagram-bot-got-me-2-500-real-followers-for-5-in-server-costs-e40491358340

  So, who is this talk suited for?

  If you're just starting out with python, are interested in automation
  or simply like to see a fun and interesting little open source
  project, I'd love to see you at my talk and hear your ideas and
  opinions about it.

  With the adventure in the source code of the site of EuroPython, we
  have detected that the code was difficult to maintain. With the
  members of the Web team, we have started to refactor the code with
  the best practices and good concept. Also, we will see some awesome
  libraries for the Django project.

  In brief, you have a legacy code and you want to improve it with best
  practices, then this talk is for you.

  You don't want to break it but you don't want to change it because
  you can break it at all times, we will show you how to improve an
  existing code with some tools and best practices, and your code can
  be deploy on Friday evening with no risk.

  From a nightmare to a dream.

  Keywords, TDD, Refactoring, Tests, BDD, Selenium, CI, and many more...

  "description": "The talk presents results from my PhD project on models for transportation\nrelated pollution.\n\nPollution from personal transport in Cities is a big and growing problem.\nBy monitoring the flow, and congestion in the transport system two goals\ncan be achieved. First, the adherence to agreed limit values\n(or breaking said limits) can be followed and used to decrease\nhealth effects of local pollution hotspots. Secondly, monitoring\nof the total emission of climate forcing gases from transportation,\nis important for designing climate mitigation actions.\n\nPython is used in combination with other tools to convert sensor data\nfrom smartphones, into pollution concentrations in urban settings.\nTo mitigate the lack of complete data coverage, the missing data is\nsimulated by a traffic model, to locate congestion and model the\ntraffic related pollution concentration.",

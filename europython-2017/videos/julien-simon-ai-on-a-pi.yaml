  In recent months, Artificial Intelligence has become the hottest
  topic in the IT industry. In this session, we’ll first explain how
  Deep Learning — a subset of AI — differs from traditional Machine
  Learning and how it can help you solve complex problems such as
  computer vision or natural language processing. Then, we’ll show you
  how to start writing Deep Learning applications in Python thanks to
  MXNet, a popular library for Deep Learning for both CPUs and GPUs.
  We'll also see how to use pre-trained models and we'll load one on a
  Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera. Finally, we’ll show random
  objects to the Pi…and listen to what it thinks the objects are,
  thanks to the text-to-speech capabilities of Amazon Polly.

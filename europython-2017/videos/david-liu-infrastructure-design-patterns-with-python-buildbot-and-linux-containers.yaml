  In today’s world of fast-paced development, infrastructure can get
  left behind quickly, leading to a potential increase in technical
  debt. Buildbot is normally known to be a continuous integration (CI)
  framework built in Python, but can be refashioned to solve
  infrastructure design patterns that arise in enterprise or production
  and deployment situations. Using Python and native Buildbot
  components paired with Linux Containers, patterns such as license
  management, resource allocation, load balancing, and enterprise
  application deployment can be architected quickly with room for
  expansion as one’s needs grow.

  Learn how to move past the CI mindset and construct infrastructure
  needs with Buildbot and popular Linux Containers such as Docker and
  ClearContainers. Attendees will learn the best known methods of
  configuring Buildbot in non-CI implementations, and how to utilize
  the framework components for future needs.

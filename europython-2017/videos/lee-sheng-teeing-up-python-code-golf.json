  "description": "Code golfing is an interesting heuristic dedicated to minimizing the\noverall length of code to produce the same functionality. The result\ndoesn\u2019t have to be incomprehensible, and in fact, we can make the\ncode more Pythonic in the process!\n\nConcise code helps future readers of the code understand the intent\nwithout getting distracted by implementation errata. We\u2019ll cover\nnumerous features of Python which allow complex ideas to be expressed\nconcisely without sacrificing readability.\n\nBroad subtopics:\n\n- Why even bother?\n- Default! The two sweetest words in the english language!\n- The Joy of Tuples\n- Comprehending Comprehensions\n- Who\u2019s afraid of Functional Programming?\n- Ideas in Context Managers\n\nSlides: https://goo.gl/hGk7nX",

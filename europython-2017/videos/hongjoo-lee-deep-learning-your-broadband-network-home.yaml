  Most of us have broadband internet services at home. Sometimes it
  does not work well, and we visit speed test page and check internet
  speed for ourselves or call cable company to report the service
  failure. As a Python programmer, have you ever tried to automate the
  internet speed test on a regular basis? Have you ever thought about
  logging the data and analyzing the time series ?

  In this talk, we will go through the whole process of data mining and
  knowledge discovery. Firstly we write a script to run speed test
  periodically and log the metric. Then we parse the log data and
  convert them into a time series and visualize the data for a certain
  period.

  Next we conduct some data analysis; finding trends, forecasting, and
  detecting anomalous data. There will be several statistic or deep
  learning techniques used for the analysis; ARIMA (Autoregressive
  Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).

  The goal is to provide basic idea how to run speed test and collect
  metrics by automated script in Python. Also, I will provide high
  level concept of the methodologies for analyzing time series data.
  Also, I would like to motivate Python people to try this at home.

  This session is designed to be accessible to everyone, including
  anyone with no expertise in mathematics, computer science.
  Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and some Python
  tools bringing such concepts into practice might be helpful, but not
  necessary for the audience.

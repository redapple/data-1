  "description": "Winton ingests data continually from the world's financial markets.\nWe track millions of individual timeseries, with divergent formats,\nfrom disparate time zones, and whose frequencies vary from months\nto milliseconds. We go beyond simply reading and storing it -\nwe stitch distinct and vast data sets together and subject them to\nintricate calculations in real-time.\n\nThis talk will focus on the way we use Python to achieve these ends,\nand how we are creating tools to further commoditise streaming as a service.",

  Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript is obligatory for every Web
  developer in todays world. Most of us are familiar with the pain of
  having to write some simple hide/show logic and ajax queries with
  jQuery on a page that is mostly rendered server-side. Nowadays,
  however, there are lots of great JavaScript frameworks and build
  tools that not only make these things very easy to do The Right Way,
  but also make the whole process quite painless.

  I spent past year in a small startup writing only front-end code and
  evaluating different tools and best practises. Bringing these tools
  to old Django projects has been eye-opening. There are practically no
  documentation or code examples on how to integrate these things to
  Python backend projects, so it’s very hard to get started from
  scratch. In this talk we’ll go trough some of the tools, examples on
  how to get started, and also some coding guidelines on how to make
  JavaScript look and feel more sane and Pythonic.

  The current state of JavaScript frameworks is notoriously bad; there
  are more of them than blog engines written with Django. We’ll focus
  on Vue.js (https://vuejs.org) which is a lightweight, very easy to
  get started and yet powerful tool.

  We’ll also take a look at new end-to-end browser test tools and
  modern build tools that enable us to take full advantage of the huge
  NPM package universe (Cheeseshop for JS)  and write modern
  ES2015/ES2016 JavaScript that has more powerful and cleaner syntax.

  Scientific aircraft research flights have to be planned beforehand.

  For that it is necessary to have model forecasts of relevant
  quantities such as meteorological parameters, chemical composition or
  particle information to guide the aircraft to the location of
  interest. Typically, many scientific instruments on board those
  aircrafts used to investigate e.g. the chemical composition of the
  air in order to get new insights often with the involvement of
  different science groups.

  For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the
  Mission Support System (MSS) was developed (http://mss.rtfd.io). This
  software helps to review a big amount of metereological and model
  data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible
  regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can
  be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical
  view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be
  constructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint
  table is also possible.

  The talk gives a brief insight into the MSS software development
  current state.

  We are using the OWS interface standard.
  https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/ MSS is a client/server
  application. The QT client interacts with a paste wsgi server. The
  software is available for all platforms on conda-forge.

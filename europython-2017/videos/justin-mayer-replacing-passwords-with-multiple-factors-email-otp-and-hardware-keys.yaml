  Passwords have formed the cornerstone of I.T. system authentication
  for decades, but recent high-profile breaches have underscored the
  risks of password-based authentication systems.

  The good news is that we can replace passwords with other factors:

  - email-based authentication
  - one-time passwords (OTP)
  - hardware keys (Yubikeys/U2F, etc.)

  These factors can be used independently or in conjunction with one
  another to provide vastly greater security than the traditional
  username-plus-password combination.

  Attendees of this talk will walk away with a detailed understanding of:

  - why the traditional username-plus-password combination is failing us
  - why email-based authentication provides no less security
  - overview of one-time passwords and TOTP
  - how to store/retrieve OTP codes, including password manager support
  - state of hardware keys in general, and FIDO U2F standard in particular

  Attendees will learn how to implement these multi-factor
  authentication methods in their own Python-based web applications,
  with primary focus on methods for integrating email-based
  authentication, one-time passwords, and U2F hardware keys into
  Django-based projects.

  "description": "Coala (https://coala.io/) began as a fun project. We never believed\nthere would be anything useful growing out of it - and yet it did.\nContributors all over the world came to us and helped creating the\ncommunity as it is.\n\nBut how did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main\ncontributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?\n\nThis talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we\ncan learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over\nfounding an open source project to building a freelance agency and\nfounding a startup.\n\nParticipants will learn how they can grow an open source project,\nautomate newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start\nmaking a living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There\nis no single recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the\ntips and tricks we\u2019ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for\nentrepreneurs, wanna-be-freelancers and future or past open source\nproject founders.\n\nThis talk is completely new and has not been presented at any\nconference yet although it overlaps with previous talks of mine which\nhave received much positive feedback at previous regional PyCons. It\nwill be tested at a local meetup to ensure proper timing.",

  In close collaboration with scientists from MPG, the Max Planck
  Computing and Data Facility is engaged in the development and
  optimization of algorithms and applications for high
  performance computing, as well as in the design and implementation of
  solutions for data-intensive projects. Python is now used at MPCDF in
  the emerging area of “atom probe crystallography” (APT): a Fourier
  spectral analysis in 3D reciprocal space can be simulated in order to
  reveal both composition and crystallographic structure at the atomic
  scale of billions APT experimental data sets. The Python data
  ecosystem has proved to be well suited to this, as it has grown
  beyond the confines of single machines to embrace scalability. This
  talk aims to describe our approach to scaling across multiple GPUs,
  and the role of our visualization methods too. Our data workflow
  analysis relies on the GPU-accelerated Python software package called
  PyNX, an open source Python library which provides fast parallel
  computation scattering. The code is well suited for GPU computing,
  using both the pyCUDA and pyOpenCL libraries. Exploratory data
  analysis and performance tests are initially carried on through
  Jupyter notebooks and Python packages e.g., pandas, matplotlib,
  plotly. In production stage, interactive visualization is realized by
  using standard scientific tool, e.g. Paraview, an open-source 3D
  visualization program which e.g. requires Python modules to generate
  visualization components within VTK files.

  Code golfing is an interesting heuristic dedicated to minimizing the
  overall length of code to produce the same functionality. The result
  doesn’t have to be incomprehensible, and in fact, we can make the
  code more Pythonic in the process!

  Concise code helps future readers of the code understand the intent
  without getting distracted by implementation errata. We’ll cover
  numerous features of Python which allow complex ideas to be expressed
  concisely without sacrificing readability.

  Broad subtopics:

  - Why even bother?
  - Default! The two sweetest words in the english language!
  - The Joy of Tuples
  - Comprehending Comprehensions
  - Who’s afraid of Functional Programming?
  - Ideas in Context Managers

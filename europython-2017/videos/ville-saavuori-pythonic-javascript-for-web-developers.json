  "description": "Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript is obligatory for every Web\ndeveloper in todays world. Most of us are familiar with the pain of\nhaving to write some simple hide/show logic and ajax queries with\njQuery on a page that is mostly rendered server-side. Nowadays,\nhowever, there are lots of great JavaScript frameworks and build\ntools that not only make these things very easy to do The Right Way,\nbut also make the whole process quite painless.\n\nI spent past year in a small startup writing only front-end code and\nevaluating different tools and best practises. Bringing these tools\nto old Django projects has been eye-opening. There are practically no\ndocumentation or code examples on how to integrate these things to\nPython backend projects, so it\u2019s very hard to get started from\nscratch. In this talk we\u2019ll go trough some of the tools, examples on\nhow to get started, and also some coding guidelines on how to make\nJavaScript look and feel more sane and Pythonic.\n\nThe current state of JavaScript frameworks is notoriously bad; there\nare more of them than blog engines written with Django. We\u2019ll focus\non Vue.js (https://vuejs.org) which is a lightweight, very easy to\nget started and yet powerful tool.\n\nWe\u2019ll also take a look at new end-to-end browser test tools and\nmodern build tools that enable us to take full advantage of the huge\nNPM package universe (Cheeseshop for JS)  and write modern\nES2015/ES2016 JavaScript that has more powerful and cleaner syntax.",

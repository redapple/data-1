  Perhaps it’s highly distributed? Or you recently walked onto a team
  with an unfamiliar codebase? Have you noticed your service responds
  slower than molasses? This talk will walk you through how to pinpoint
  bottlenecks, approaches and tools to make improvements, and make you
  seem like the hero! All in a day’s work.

  The talk will describe various types of tracing a web service,
  including black &amp; white box tracing, tracing distributed systems,
  as well as various tools and external services available to measure
  performance. I’ll also present a few different rabbit holes to dive
  into when trying to improve your service’s performance.

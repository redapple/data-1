  Unreal Engine is the game industry leading platform for developing
  AAA Videogames. Now you can script your gameplay logic, automate your
  development pipelines or test your productions with Python too. The
  UnrealEnginePython plugin aims at covering the whole feature set of
  Unreal Engine 4 and extending it with the huge modules library
  available in the Python world.

  The talk will briefly introduce the Unreal Engine platform and its
  capabilities as well as how it can be programmed without the python
  plugin (Blueprints and C++).

  The biggest part of the talk will focus on how the Unreal Engine 4
  patterns are mapped to the python plugin, what is already working and
  what you can expect from future developments.

  No prior knowledge of game/graphics programming is required,  and if
  you are in the movie or cartoon industry you can get interesting
  infos too

  The Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) has been used to
  support learning in different scenarios, including taught courses,
  self-directed learning and reference material such as software
  documentation. People have used it to learn how to program, and to
  learn about diverse subjects where computer code is important to
  human understanding. The aim of this talk is to dive into where and
  how notebooks can be used most effectively for education.

  I will first describe notebook-based learning material created by a
  variety of people for different purposes, deliberately taking a broad
  definition of ‘education’, along with my own experiences using
  notebooks to teach Software Carpentry sessions and conference
  tutorials. I’ll pull out both strengths and limitations of notebooks
  as an educational tool to explore how they can be used most
  effectively.

  In the second part of the talk, I’ll talk about several extra
  software tools which can make the notebook more valuable in
  educational settings, including Jupyterhub, with which a teacher can
  provide notebook servers for a group of students, nbgrader, which
  allows notebooks to be used as assignments, and cite2c, which can
  insert academic citations into notebooks. I’ll also touch on
  commercial offerings integrating the notebook, such as SageMathCloud.

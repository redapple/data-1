  With 4 datacenters on-line and more coming fast, building and
  operating datacenter buildings becomes a problem we need to solve at
  scale. At Facebook, Several teams of Production Engineers write the
  software that helps us do this efficiently, and we use Python... a
  lot.

  In this talk, I will go into some detail about only some of problems
  we try to solve to make sure our datacenters come online on time so
  that we can make sure you can connect with all your friends on
  Facebook, and keep them humming, as efficiently as possible.

  We'll go into some detail about the awesome Python infrastructure
  (some of it open source), that we use to build this software, and
  some of the engineering practices.

  This is a talk for you if you were wondering how to track each and
  every strand of fiber cabling within a datacenter, or make sure we
  find out that the cooling system isn't really doing it's thing before
  actual servers catch fire from serving you live videos.

  When developing and maintaining many different services, unit testing
  is not enough to make sure your code works in production. By now,
  many teams doing SOA (service-oriented architectures) have a set of
  end-to-end tests that cover critical workflows to make sure these
  work. For these tests, all of the utilized services need to have the
  proper test fixture data in their datastores. This often leads to
  developers having to deal with raw datastore data (like JSON or SQL)
  for these tests, making the authoring of those tests very slow,
  tedious, and error-prone.

  This talk is going to discuss several approaches we tried at Yelp to
  generating these fixture data in a quicker, developer-friendly and
  more correct way.

  The main part of the talk will be a deep-dive into what fixture
  factories are, how to implement them and how to integrate them with
  pytest, the leading Python testing framework. I'll show you several
  other benefits this approach has over writing raw fixture data and
  how this leads to more maintainable and easier to adapt code. We'll
  also explore how you can then run your tests in parallel, cutting
  down runtime drastically.

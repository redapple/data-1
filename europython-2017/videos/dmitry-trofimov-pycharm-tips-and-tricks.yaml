  PyCharm, a Python IDE with its free and open-source community
  edition, in last several years has become a tool of choice for more
  and more Python developers. But not everybody uses its full power.
  Moreover, most only use a fraction of the functionality it provides.

  The reality is that an IDE is not just about a set of integrated
  tools, but an environment that understands the semantics of your
  project, of what youâ€™re doing. It can leverage this to provide you
  with functionality that can make repetitive mundane tasks become
  frictionless, as well as give insight into potential problems.

  In this session, we will go through the most powerful features the
  IDE offers and whether you do web development or work with data using
  Python, you will benefit knowing how the IDE can leverage your
  programming skills.

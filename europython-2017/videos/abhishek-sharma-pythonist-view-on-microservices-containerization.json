  "description": "Microservices architecture and containerization are words thrown around\nwhen we talk about designing systems that are loosely coupled, although\nit may sound like buzz words but these key concepts play a very important\npart in system as a whole.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how microservices can be implemented in python\nusing available open source frameworks and how it can be deployed independently\nto scale and perform in production environment.\nI'll also share several use-cases where it is worth planning and developing\nsystem architecture considering microservices/containerization and will\nalso discuss some trade-off of having such architecture.\n\nOutline:\n\n- Overview of microservices\n- Implementing microservices using Python\n- Advantages of microservices over Monolithic / SoA architecture\n- Overview of containerization\n- How to containerize Python based services (Docker)\n- Advantages of microservices/containerization over traditional deployment\n- CI/CD Approach in microservices and containerization\n- Usecases where to use microservices\n- Trade-off of using microservices",

  This talk will introduce you to Sanic, the Python 3 web framework
  that supports async request handlers with a simple, Flask-like, API.

  We will start with a Sanic overview and compare it with other similar
  options before looking at the API and working through a basic app.
  Our goal here will be to get a feel for the Sanic API and demonstrate
  how it fits together. After this we will cover some of the more
  unique and interesting possibilities with Sanic, such as support for
  websockets and HTTP2.

  A web framework is often only as powerful as its ecosystem, so we
  will take a look at some of the popular Sanic extensions for
  databases, templating and testing.

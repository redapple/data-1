  Historically, Python coding on Windows has been kind of troublesome,
  but not anymore. Since a couple of years ago it is possible write
  awesome quality Python code with Visual Studio. This is good news for
  Python developers of all levels, because Visual Studio offers and
  incredible set of tools to enhance all the stages of product
  development: from managing virtual environments and handling package
  management, to writing and refactoring code, up to testing &
  debugging - all of that for free. In this talk I will demo how you
  can use Visual Studio to boost your Python development on Windows.

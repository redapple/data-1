  Being dissatisfied with some of the constraints and complex usage of
  Genshi, the TurboGears2 team started working on an alternative that
  could solve Genshi speed issues, complex inheritance system and be
  backward compatible with genshi templates.

  This is a talk about what lead to the creation of the Kajiki template
  engine and what's particular about it.

  The talk will cover:

  - Comparison on the major template engines available in python
    to showcase what's special in Kajiki (validated, xml based)
    what was special in Genshi (also lazy evaluated)
  - What's a validated template engine and why it's good to have one.
  - How Kajiki works, showcase kajiki syntax, it's performances and how
    to use it in any python project.
  - Why Kajiki is fast, code generation applied and how to write a code
    generation template engine like Kajiki and Jinja2 (showcase a simple
    50 lines of code template engine that uses code generation).

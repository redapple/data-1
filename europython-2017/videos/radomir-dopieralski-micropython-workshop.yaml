  We will program some ESP8266-based development boards, make them
  blink LEDs, move servos, display pictures, read sensors, react to
  buttons, and, more importantly, talk over HTTP and MQTT with servers.
  This is an excellent occasion to try your skills in building and
  programming small electronic devices. No experience with electronics
  is required, everything you need to know will be covered during the
  workshop.

  You will need to bring a laptop with a USB port. If it runs Windows,
  make sure to have some terminal emulator installed, such as PuTTy,
  CoolTerm or  even HyperTerm. On Linux and OSX we will use Screen, so
  you don't need anything special.

  I only have about 20 kits for this, so the number of people that can
  take part is limited.

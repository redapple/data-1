  Logs are your best friends on those late nights when you try to
  troubleshoot that problem in production that was written by a friend
  of you who is on holidays at the moment. Logs are the main way to
  know what is happening at runtime with an running application but as
  we donâ€™t realize how important they are until we actually need them
  it is usually an under appreciated part of our development process.

  This talks overviews the logging module of the standard library and
  demonstrates some basic best practices and techniques make the most
  out of our logging when we need it.

  After this talk you will be fully familiar not only on how to use the
  logging library but also how it is actually designed, how it works,
  how to extended further than the basic usage and some sample recipes
  and configurations for complex applications.

  Recent releases like AsyncIO and Django Channels gave a new push
  towards building real-time web-apps fast and easy. However, as
  similar tools exist in Python since 2000th, how should we balance
  between modern and time-proven?

  This talk includes but is not focused just on AsyncIO. It gives an
  overview of Async libraries in Python, and helps with choosing a
  right tool for various web tasks.

  It describes caveats of using Twisted, Tornado and AsyncIO including
  theory and live code, and concludes with a basic overview of Django Channels.

  Talk plan

  - Why do we need Async Web (5 min)
  - Existing libraries and frameworks:  Twisted, Tornado, AsyncIO (15 min)
  - Sample task, sample code, conclusions (10 min)
  - (optional) what's about Django Channels?
  - Q & A (5 min)

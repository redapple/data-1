  "description": "Historically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain\nfor even the most devoted Python enthusiasts. I've found myself in\nthe situation, where I did know the basic concepts behind the tools,\nbut despite that only thing I could do was following tutorials. That\nwas the time to change it and that's the reason this presentation was\nwritten.\n\nIn this talk, I'll provide a quick overview of the current state of\nPython packaging tools. I'll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and\nwheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their\nprecursors. I'll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth\nknowing. Then I'll share examples of how you can use the features of\nthe Setuptools library - those well known and those we use when\npip-installing packages, but most of us can't name them.\n\nThe point of this presentation is to explain how to use tools which\nare all there, just waiting to make developing, testing, and\ndistributing our Python packages easier. Doesn't matter if you're a\nPython expert or a beginner - the knowledge covered by this\npresentation will be useful despite your level.",

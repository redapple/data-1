  The Raspberry Pi Foundation is working to put the power of digital
  making in the hands of people all over the world, and is well known
  for its series of small, cheap single board computers.

  The Raspberry Pi runs a well supported Linux distro based on Debian,
  which ships with a variety of programming tools and educational
  software. Python is the main supported language on the platform, used
  in many educational resources, and many Python libraries exist for
  making the most of the Pi platform with other devices.

  I will cover:

  - Raspberry Pi Foundation mission
  - Raspberry Pi hardware specs
  - Raspbian desktop
  - GPIO pins
  - GPIO Zero (Python library)
  - Picamera
  - Astro Pi (ESA space mission) & Sense HAT
